### DB Schema

The diagram shows the relationship between CustomUser, Athlete, Pledge, ProgressUpdate, and Badge. Each Athlete is linked to a specific CustomUser through a foreign key, while multiple Pledges can be associated with a single Athlete or User.

The database schema for Champs Fund represents the data structure used to manage athletes, pledges, users, progress updates, and badges. It defines how data is stored, related, and retrieved within the platform, enabling efficient tracking of user contributions and athlete progress.‚Äù
